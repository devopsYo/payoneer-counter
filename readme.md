Change it to each different version (docker image tag)

**Set-up SCM Github**

Version Branch(= dev branch=master branch) TBD approach

![](https://github.com/devopsYo/payoneer-counter/blob/feature/config-pipeline/doc/branch_protection.png?raw=true)

While cycle development, the dev is merging to the current version branch 1.0.x(it’ s the trunc).

At the end of cycle development, a version branch 2.0.x is created.

**CI/CD Approach**

In the job CI, an image docker with specifically version is created and pushed to dockerhub.

In the job CD, the image with specifically version is pulled and deployed(container is started)

**Volume Creation - Availability**

Docker run -v log:/app/log

Docker run –restart=always



**Effort to create a new service** –** depends on requirements

**Future improvement :** 

Reusable: Create a template to reuse the pipeline with different parameters.

Use release in Azure DevOps for CD approach.

Scalability: Docker compose or Kubernetes(Cluster) by requirements.
